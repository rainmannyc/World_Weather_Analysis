# **World_Weather_Analysis**

# **Overview**

The purpose of this analysis was to retrieve weather data using Open Weather Map API as well as Google API. We also created a custom itinerary as well as collecting data of weather elements around the world. 

We used the API's to narrow our search down within certain temperature ranges, as well as within ranges of latitude and longitudinal coordinates. We then collected data from google to search all the nearby hotel within the temperature ranges, in the coordinates we provided.

After, we were able to generate a mock intinerary for our travelers and create a travel map along with details of the city, country, weather description, and max temperature. We were also able to map out a driving map along for an overview of the route.
